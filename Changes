   - redid the command splitter so it can handle things like perl
     (see t/06)

2.0100: Fri May  8 06:49:13 EDT 2009
   - added -g to list groups, found I was vimming my mrshrc quite
     often

   - not ready to release yet, ... I keep adding things.
   - added more docs to mrsh, fixed sigchild handling

   - Turn early non-H group arguments into -H options
     automagically
   - I think this is ready for public consumption.  I'm going to
     install it and fart around with it a little first though.

2.0000: Sat May  2 09:23:09 EDT 2009
   - docs for mrsh
   - docs for App::MrShell

   - hooray, I got the host routing stuff to actually work.  I
     proved it out on a test, but it wasn't terribly convincing.
     Then I used this: mrsh -H 'corky!wisp!corky!razor!webserver'
     'touch /tmp/holy\ shit' The escapes for that are tricky to
     get right, but it *is* possible.

   - added all kinds of bells and whistles (ok, bugfixes)
   - made the t/05 meaningful
   - convinced MrShell to allow commands with various subst vars
   - made the t/05 test *portable*, rather than using external
     linux commands

   - This is practically a finished product.
   - It works on multiple hosts.
   - There are tests.
   - There's logging.
   - There's config files...
   - it still lacks host+host routing and
   - documentation

2.0: Wed Apr 29 07:16:19 EDT 2009
   - got this more or less working, building some tests

2.0: Mon Apr 27 14:35:30 2009 -0400
   - probably going to resurrect Mr. Shell
